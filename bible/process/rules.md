## Rule ENF-PROC-BRAIN-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: Critical
**Scope**: Session
**Mandatory**: true
**Mechanical_Enforcement_Path**: .claude/hooks/validate-exit-plan.sh + writ-session.py phase state machine

### Trigger
In Work mode: when the agent attempts any code-producing tool call (Write, Edit, Bash with destructive verbs) before a design has been approved for the current task.

### Statement
In Work mode, no code-producing action is permitted before a design artifact exists and has been approved by the user. Applies to every project regardless of perceived simplicity.

### Violation
Agent in Work mode receives 'refactor this function to use async.' Without presenting approaches or waiting for approval, emits Write(src/api.py, ...). Gate denies the write; friction log records the attempt.

### Pass
Agent in Work mode receives 'refactor this function to use async.' Presents 3 approaches with trade-offs, asks clarifying questions, waits for user to say 'approved — go with option A,' then emits Write. Gate permits the write because session.design_approved = true.

### Enforcement
.claude/hooks/validate-exit-plan.sh + writ-session.py phase state machine check session.mode == 'work' AND session.design_approved == true before any code-producing tool call.

### Rationale
The canonical failure mode of agentic coding is premature implementation on tasks the agent considered simple. This rule makes 'too simple' impossible as a rationalization — the gate fires regardless of task size.

<!-- RULE START: ENF-PROC-DEBUG-001 -->
## Rule ENF-PROC-DEBUG-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: High
**Scope**: Task
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When the agent is actively debugging (session.mode == 'debug') and proposes a fix without documented root-cause evidence.

### Statement
Advisory rule: fixes during debug mode should cite root-cause evidence in the same response. No mechanical enforcement path — advisory because lexical detection of 'evidence' is unreliable.

### Violation
Agent in debug mode says 'let me try changing X' without having explained why X is the cause. Advisory warning surfaced to agent in response bundle.

### Pass
Agent in debug mode says 'The failure appears at line 42 when request.body is empty. Fix: validate body before accessing. Evidence: traceback shows KeyError at line 42.' Advisory passes.

### Enforcement
Advisory only — surfaced as part of debug-mode always-on bundle. No deny condition. Friction-logged when agent claims success on fix without evidence.

### Rationale
Symptom-patching is the canonical debug-mode failure. Forcing evidence-cite discipline reduces it, but no reliable lexical detector exists for 'is this evidence?' so the rule stays advisory.

## Rule ENF-PROC-PLAN-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: High
**Scope**: Task
**Mandatory**: true
**Mechanical_Enforcement_Path**: .claude/hooks/validate-exit-plan.sh (Tier 1) + writ-quality-judge.sh (Tier 2)

### Trigger
When a plan.md artifact is written and contains placeholder content (TBD, TODO, 'similar to N') or fails structural quality gate.

### Statement
plan.md artifacts must contain no placeholder content, exact file paths, and complete code blocks. Gate 5 Tier 1 (structural) denies writes with placeholder text in any plan section.

### Violation
plan.md contains 'Step 5: implement appropriate error handling, similar to Step 3.' Gate 5 Tier 1 matches 'appropriate' and 'similar to' in the blocklist, denies the write, logs to friction log.

### Pass
plan.md Step 5: 'In src/api.py line 42, wrap the fetch() call in try/except OrderNotFoundError, log the error with order_id context, re-raise.' Concrete path, concrete change, concrete reasoning. Gate passes.

### Enforcement
Gate 5 Tier 1 via validate-exit-plan.sh: lexical match against placeholder blocklist (TBD, TODO, fill in, appropriate, similar to, as needed, placeholder). Gate 5 Tier 2 via Haiku judge rubric on PostToolUse for semantic-level boilerplate.

### Rationale
Placeholder plans transfer design decisions to the implementer as interpretation. They are the canonical failure mode of AI-generated planning.

## Rule ENF-PROC-SDD-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: High
**Scope**: Task
**Mandatory**: true
**Mechanical_Enforcement_Path**: .claude/hooks/writ-sdd-review-order.sh

### Trigger
When subagent-driven development is active and reviewers are dispatched out of order (code-quality before spec-compliance, or either review skipped).

### Statement
Spec-compliance review must complete before code-quality review starts. Out-of-order dispatch denied by gate.

### Violation
Agent dispatches ROL-CODE-REVIEWER-001 before ROL-SPEC-REVIEWER-001 has returned findings. Gate denies the Task dispatch.

### Pass
Agent dispatches ROL-SPEC-REVIEWER-001, waits for findings, resolves any, then dispatches ROL-CODE-REVIEWER-001. Gate permits.

### Enforcement
writ-sdd-review-order.sh on PreToolUse Task: checks session.review_ordering_state for the current task. Denies if code-reviewer dispatched before spec-reviewer has completed.

### Rationale
Spec-first catches wrong-thing-built. Polishing wrong code is wasted work.

## Rule ENF-PROC-TDD-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: Critical
**Scope**: Task
**Mandatory**: true
**Mechanical_Enforcement_Path**: .claude/hooks/validate-test-file.sh

### Trigger
In Work mode: when a Write or Edit to a production source file is attempted without a corresponding test file containing assertions.

### Statement
Production code requires a failing test before implementation. Gate denies Write/Edit to src/** paths without corresponding tests/** file containing lexical test markers.

### Violation
Agent in Work mode attempts Write(src/api.py, 'def fetch(url): ...') without tests/test_api.py existing or containing assertions. Gate denies. Friction log records 'gate_denied: ENF-PROC-TDD-001'.

### Pass
Agent writes tests/test_api.py with test_fetch_returns_json (containing assert statement), runs pytest (fails as expected — function doesn't exist), then Write(src/api.py, 'def fetch(url): ...'). Gate permits because test exists.

### Enforcement
validate-test-file.sh: on PreToolUse Write matching src/**/*.{py,js,ts,php}, find corresponding test file, check for lexical assertion markers (assert|expect|should|test_). Deny if missing.

### Rationale
Test-first discipline is what the skill teaches. Mechanical enforcement makes the discipline impossible to rationalize around.

## Rule ENF-PROC-VERIFY-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: Critical
**Scope**: Session
**Mandatory**: true
**Mechanical_Enforcement_Path**: .claude/hooks/writ-verify-before-claim.sh

### Trigger
When the agent attempts to mark a TodoWrite item complete, or when the session's Stop hook fires and completion claims exist without verification evidence.

### Statement
Completion claims require fresh verification evidence in the same message. TodoWrite completion denied without verification_evidence set in session state.

### Violation
Agent marks todo 'implement fetch()' as completed in TodoWrite without running pytest in the current message. Gate denies. Friction log records 'gate_denied: ENF-PROC-VERIFY-001'.

### Pass
Agent runs pytest tests/test_api.py, output shows '1 passed', quotes the output, then TodoWrite marks todo completed with verification_evidence='pytest tests/test_api.py: 1 passed'.

### Enforcement
writ-verify-before-claim.sh on PreToolUse TodoWrite + Stop: checks session.verification_evidence for the claimed item. Deny if missing or stale.

### Rationale
Completion claims without evidence erode user trust. Mechanical enforcement prevents the confidence-as-evidence failure mode.

<!-- RULE START: ENF-PROC-WORKTREE-001 -->
## Rule ENF-PROC-WORKTREE-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: High
**Scope**: Task
**Mandatory**: true
**Mechanical_Enforcement_Path**: .claude/hooks/writ-worktree-safety.sh

### Trigger
When the agent runs git worktree add <path> where <path> is inside the repo tree and is not listed in .gitignore.

### Statement
Project-local worktree directories must be gitignored. Bash gate denies 'git worktree add' commands targeting non-ignored repo-local paths.

### Violation
Agent runs 'git worktree add ./work_trees/feature-x' without adding './work_trees/' to .gitignore. Gate denies the Bash call.

### Pass
Agent confirms .gitignore contains '.worktrees/' or equivalent, then runs 'git worktree add .worktrees/feature-x'. Gate permits.

### Enforcement
writ-worktree-safety.sh on PreToolUse Bash matching 'git worktree add': parse target path, check .gitignore, deny if project-local and not ignored.

### Rationale
Non-ignored project-local worktrees pollute the main branch's working tree and cause accidental commits. The safety check is absolute, not advisory.

<!-- RULE START: PROC-BRANCH-001 -->
## Rule PROC-BRANCH-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: Low
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When creating a feature branch.

### Statement
Feature branches are named with a ticket/issue reference: `bug/ORD-1234-negative-quantity`, `feat/ORD-1500-tenant-scoping`. Ad-hoc branch names without a tracking reference are violations.

### Violation
```
branch: lucio-fix-2
```

### Pass
```
branch: fix/ORD-1421-tenant-scoping
```

### Enforcement
Repository branch-naming convention. PR template checks.

### Rationale
Traceable branch names link code to issue tracker to release notes. Untraceable names break the audit trail.

<!-- RULE START: PROC-CHANGELOG-001 -->
## Rule PROC-CHANGELOG-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: Medium
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When releasing user-facing changes.

### Statement
User-facing changes are documented in a changelog or release-notes file. The audience is end users / API consumers / customers, not engineers. Behavior changes, new features, breaking changes, deprecations are all logged.

### Violation
```
# CHANGELOG.md last updated 6 months ago; production has shipped 50 features since.
```

### Pass
```
# CHANGELOG.md:
# ## v2.5.0 (2026-05-10)
# - Added: tenant scoping on /api/orders.
# - Fixed: negative-quantity bypass on order creation.
# - Deprecated: /v1/legacy-orders (sunset 2026-09-01).
```

### Enforcement
Release-process tooling (changesets, conventional-changelog, knope) generates from commits.

### Rationale
Changelogs are the contract with consumers: they can plan integrations from a written record, not from reverse-engineering deploys.

<!-- RULE START: PROC-COMMIT-001 -->
## Rule PROC-COMMIT-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: Medium
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When writing commit messages.

### Statement
Commit messages follow a conventional format: a short subject line (`type: subject` or just a clear summary), and a body for non-trivial changes describing the why. Single-line drive-by messages on substantive changes are violations.

### Violation
```
fix stuff
```

### Pass
```
fix: reject negative quantities in /api/orders

Negative quantities bypassed the existing balance check and produced
double-credit refunds. Adds SEC-VAL-RANGE-001 guard plus regression test.
```

### Enforcement
Code review.

### Rationale
Commit messages are read by every future engineer and during every incident. The 30 seconds spent writing a clear message saves hours later.

<!-- RULE START: PROC-DEPLOY-001 -->
## Rule PROC-DEPLOY-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: High
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When deploying code to production.

### Statement
Production deploys go through a CI/CD pipeline. Manual deploys (scp, ssh, kubectl apply) are forbidden for production. The pipeline runs tests, builds artifacts, applies migrations, and rolls out via the deployment strategy.

### Violation
```
# Engineer SSHes into prod and runs `git pull && systemctl restart`.
# No record, no rollback path, no test gate.
```

### Pass
```
# `git push origin main` triggers CI; CI runs tests, builds image, applies
# migrations, deploys to staging, promotes to prod after smoke tests pass.
```

### Enforcement
CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, ArgoCD, Spinnaker).

### Rationale
Pipelined deploys are reproducible, gated, and auditable. Manual deploys produce drift, skip checks, and have no rollback.

<!-- RULE START: PROC-ENV-001 -->
## Rule PROC-ENV-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: Medium
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When handling production credentials.

### Statement
Production credentials are never shared in code, chat (Slack, Teams, email), tickets, or other text artifacts. They live exclusively in the secret management service. Sharing a credential is a security incident; the credential is rotated.

### Violation
```
Slack DM: 'here is the prod DB password: hunter2'
```

### Pass
```
Slack DM: 'request access via 1Password vault: production-database'
```

### Enforcement
Slack DLP scanning. Security training. Incident response on credential exposure.

### Rationale
Once a credential is in a chat scroll, it lives forever in every chat client, every backup, and every export. Secret managers eliminate the durable exposure.

<!-- RULE START: PROC-INCIDENT-001 -->
## Rule PROC-INCIDENT-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: Medium
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When an incident occurs in production.

### Statement
Post-incident review produces action items with owners and deadlines. Action items are tracked to completion; the incident is not closed until they are. Blameless: the review focuses on systemic causes, not individual error.

### Violation
```
# Incident retro: 'we'll do better next time'; no tracked actions; same incident next month.
```

### Pass
```
# Postmortem doc: timeline, root cause, action items.
# Action: 'Add retry budget to upstream call (@alice, due 2026-05-24)'.
# Tracked in ticket system; reviewed weekly.
```

### Enforcement
Postmortem template + tracking. Incident-management platform (PagerDuty, Incident.io, FireHydrant).

### Rationale
Untracked retro actions guarantee the incident repeats. Tracked actions are the difference between learning and re-learning.

<!-- RULE START: PROC-PLAN-001 -->
## Rule PROC-PLAN-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: High
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When starting any task that involves modifying code.

### Statement
Work mode requires a written plan before any production code is written. The plan covers files to be touched, an analysis of constraints, the rules that apply, and the capabilities to be tested. ENF-PROC-PLAN-001 and ENF-PROC-BRAIN-001 mechanically enforce this for the Writ workflow; the policy itself is universal.

### Violation
```
# Developer starts editing main.py directly; no plan written. Code lands
# scope-creeping into adjacent concerns; reviewer cannot tell what the
# author intended versus what they touched incidentally.
```

### Pass
```
# plan.md written first. Files: orders/service.py, orders/repo.py.
# Analysis: existing patterns for tenant scoping; constraint: no schema
# change. Rules applied: SEC-AUTHZ-TENANT-001, ARCH-LAYER-001.
# Capabilities: list orders for current tenant; reject cross-tenant access.
```

### Enforcement
ENF-PROC-PLAN-001 (format check) + ENF-PROC-BRAIN-001 (design before code) gates. Code review.

### Rationale
A written plan exposes scope creep before code lands. The plan is also the artifact a reviewer reads first to know what to evaluate against.

<!-- RULE START: PROC-REVIEW-001 -->
## Rule PROC-REVIEW-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: Medium
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When merging a change to a shared branch.

### Statement
Code is reviewed by at least one other person or a reviewer agent before merge. Auto-merge on green CI is permitted only for trivial mechanical changes (dependency updates, formatter pushes) and is configured per-repo.

### Violation
```
# Author merges their own PR moments after opening.
```

### Pass
```
# PR requires a reviewer approval; reviewer reads the diff and the plan;
# explicitly approves or requests changes.
```

### Enforcement
Repository branch protection rule.

### Rationale
A second pair of eyes catches scope errors, missing tests, and security oversights that the author normalized to. The check is cheap relative to the cost of fixing in production.

<!-- RULE START: PROC-ROLLBACK-001 -->
## Rule PROC-ROLLBACK-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: High
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When designing the deployment system.

### Statement
Deployment strategy supports rollback within minutes: blue-green, canary, feature flag, or `helm rollback` / `kubectl rollout undo`. A deploy that cannot be reverted produces extended outages on every bad change.

### Violation
```
# Deployment overwrites the previous image; rollback requires rebuilding
# the prior commit, taking minutes-to-hours.
```

### Pass
```
# Blue-green: both versions running; LB switches; rollback is an LB flip.
# Or: image versions in registry; rollback redeploys the prior tag.
```

### Enforcement
Deployment-platform config review.

### Rationale
Rollback is the most important property of the deployment system. Without it, every deploy is a one-way bet.

<!-- RULE END: PROC-ROLLBACK-001 -->

<!-- RULE START: PROC-TEST-001 -->
## Rule PROC-TEST-001

**Domain**: process
**Severity**: High
**Scope**: Component
**Mandatory**: false

### Trigger
When implementing production code that is not a one-shot script.

### Statement
Test skeletons are written and approved before the implementation. Tests carry the contract; the implementation conforms to them. ENF-PROC-TDD-001 mechanically enforces this in the Writ workflow.

### Violation
```
# Implementation lands first; tests added afterwards to match what was
# built. Tests validate the implementation, not the intent.
```

### Pass
```
# tests/test_orders_cancellation.py written first with failing tests.
# Implementation iterates until tests pass. Tests document intent.
```

### Enforcement
ENF-PROC-TDD-001 (failing test before src/ write) gate. Code review.

### Rationale
Test-first ensures tests describe the contract independent of the implementation. Test-after risks tests that codify whatever the implementation happens to do.

<!-- RULE END: PROC-TEST-001 -->
