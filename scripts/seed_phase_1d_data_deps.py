"""Phase 1D of the public rulebook expansion: Data Protection + Dependencies.

Seeds 10 new SEC-DATA-* and SEC-DEP-* rules into Neo4j (1 mandatory),
renames the legacy SEC-UNI-003 -> SEC-DATA-PII-002 (broader public-rulebook
phrasing), and deletes ENF-SEC-002 as a duplicate of SEC-DATA-PII-002.

Idempotent. Re-runs MERGE existing rules with the same rule_id.

Per the public rulebook source: out-of-the-box-rules.md sections 1H, 1I.
