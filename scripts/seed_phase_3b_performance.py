"""Phase 3B of the public rulebook expansion: Performance & Caching.

Seeds 14 new PERF-* rules into Neo4j (1 mandatory: PERF-QUERY-001 N+1).

PERF-LAZY-001 already exists with a PHP-specific Writ statement and
matches the public-rulebook semantics; the existing rule is kept as-is.

The Writ-specific performance rules are retained as project-specific
extensions (different scope from the public set):
  PERF-IO-001       hot-path sync-I/O ban (stricter than PERF-ASYNC-001)
  PERF-QBUDGET-001  Query Budget Plan process rule (complements PERF-QUERY-004)
  PERF-BIGO-001     nested-loop algorithmic complexity (orthogonal to PERF-QUERY-002 indexes)
  PERF-OPT-001      "don't optimize without measure" (no public equivalent)

Idempotent. Re-runs MERGE existing rules with the same rule_id.

Per the public rulebook source: out-of-the-box-rules.md section 8.
